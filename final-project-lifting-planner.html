        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This web application will include a user login interface and hold data given by the user in a database. Lifting Planner will take in the user's height, weight, and the max weight that</p>
        <p>they can do for all core lifts and use that information to determine a workout plan that suits them. The workout plan will have the lifts that the user will be doing every day of the</p>
        <p>week as well as how much weight is recommended for each lift. The purpose of this application is to have the user be able to easily access a workout plan that is right for them.</p>
